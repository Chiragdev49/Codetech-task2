Obective:
The objective is to build a to-do list application where users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. The app will utilize local storage to save tasks, ensuring that the data persists even after the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

Key Activities:
Key activities include designing the user interface with input fields and buttons, implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks, and utilizing local storage to persist data across sessions. Event handling will enable task management, while testing and debugging will ensure smooth functionality. UX improvements and responsive design will enhance the overall user experience.

Technology Used:
HTML: For structuring the web page, including the input fields, buttons, and task list.
CSS: For styling the application and ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: For implementing the logic of CRUD operations, event handling, and interacting with local storage.
Local Storage (Web API): For persisting tasks between sessions by storing them in the browserâ€™s local storage.
